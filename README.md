# 🧠 Relational Field Network (RFN)

> A new neural network architecture that models **pairwise feature interactions** directly within vector inputs — with no need for sequences, graphs, or convolutions.

---

## ✨ Overview

**Relational Field Network (RFN)** is a lightweight yet expressive architecture that learns **how input features influence each other** using a fully differentiable attention-like mechanism. Unlike Transformers (which operate over tokens or sequences) or GNNs (which require graph structures), RFN works directly on **plain vector/tabular data** — making it ideal for:

- 🧪 Scientific modeling  
- 📊 Tabular learning  
- 🧠 Symbolic reasoning  
- 🔍 Explainable AI  

---

## 🔧 Architecture Summary

Each **Relational Field Layer** does:
1. Feature projection into key and query vectors
2. Computation of pairwise relation scores across features
3. Weighted updates to each feature based on relational attention

This results in a learned **feature-to-feature influence matrix** that evolves layer-by-layer.

```python
x = [f1, f2, ..., fn] → Relational Field Layer → Updated features → Output
```

RFNs can be stacked like MLP layers and trained end-to-end using any standard loss.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### ✅ 1. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install torch scikit-learn matplotlib
```

### 🧪 2. Run Demo on UCI Breast Cancer Dataset and Regression

```bash
Relational_filed_network.ipynb
```

This script trains an RFN for binary classification and prints test accuracy and loss.

> 💡 You should see >96% accuracy after 100 epochs — comparable to or better than an MLP.

## 🧠 Why RFN?

| Feature                        | Benefit |
|-------------------------------|---------|
| 🔍 Feature-wise attention      | Learns how input features affect each other |
| ⚡ No structure assumptions     | No graphs, no sequences, just raw vectors |
| 🧩 Plug-and-play               | Can replace MLPs in many pipelines |
| 📈 High accuracy on tabular data | Works well even on small datasets |
| 🧬 Interpretable interaction maps | Visualize feature influence matrices |

---

## 📊 Example: Breast Cancer Classification

| Model | Test Accuracy |
|-------|---------------|
| MLP   | ~95%          |
| RFN   | **96–98%**     |

## 🔬 How It Works (Under the Hood)

Each RFN layer builds a **relational field**:
- Each feature `fi` attends to every other feature `fj`
- Uses learnable score functions (via small MLPs)
- Outputs new feature values as weighted sums of all others

This allows the model to learn structured dependencies such as:
- `feature_3 influences feature_7 strongly`
- `feature_10 and feature_11 act redundantly`

---

## 🧪 Ideas for Further Exploration

- ✅ Extend to **regression** or **multi-class** problems
- 🌐 Apply RFN to **real-world tabular datasets** (Kaggle, OpenML)
- 🔁 Stack with **KAN** or **transformer encoders**
- 📉 Add **dropout**, **batch norm**, or **residuals**
- 🧠 Visualize learned **relation matrices** for interpretability
